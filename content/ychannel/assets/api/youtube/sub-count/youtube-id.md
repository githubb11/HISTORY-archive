about tab

  Description
Hello there, my name is Michiel. I'm a 20 year-old with a passion for the First and Second World War. With 'The AceDestroyer' I post all kinds of video's related to the Second World War. I try to create good quality videos with maps, footage and sometimes even contemporary footage. On this channel you will find all my self-made documentaries (from 5minutes to 30minutes). I make all of my maps myself, that way I can really press my stamp on my videos. I have decided to only make WW2 videos with an occasional WW1-related video here and there.
Next to making videos I also do research to identify unknown Soldiers of the Great War who fell on Belgian soil. I have currently identified the graves of 5 British soldiers!
Feel free to subscribe to my channel. Don't worry I turned off the income button, I don't earn anything! It is a hobby and it will stay that way. None the less, I hope you'll enjoy the content I make.
Cheers!

  Description
As a military history buff I decided to do something productive with the extensive knowledge I have on battles. I will focus on not-so-well known battles as well as famous ones, from the gunpowder age to today (modern warfare). 

I do have a life apart from this, so I consider this a hobby. Meaning, I will upload whenever I get a chance.

This channel is purely educational and I do not have a patreon. However, if you want to show appreciation for the work I do, feel free to donate using the link below. Please note that there is no obligation and I will continue to upload when the time comes. Overall, this is for the military enthusiasts' enjoyment. I acknowledge all of my sources in the video description. 

Thanks, and enjoy!
